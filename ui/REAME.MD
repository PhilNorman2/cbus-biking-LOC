# Cbus Bike Safety UI

Mobile app written using react-native that allows a user to enter information about a bike route

## Prerequisites

1. [NodeJS 12.8.3 and NPM 6.14.6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Expo](https://expo.io/learn) Install globally via NPM: `%npm install expo-cli --global`

## Running

Run `%npm run web` to run the app on the Expo server. This should open a browser tab to http://localhost:19002 that contains a debugging interface, and also opens a web browser tab with the app display. You can also display the app interface on your mobile devide by downloading the Expo client app from the app store and scanning the QR code that is displayed in the debugging interface.

In the browser view, it is recommended to use your browser's devtools to change the size of the display to that of a mobile device. This can be done in Chrome by opening the debug tools, clicking on the icon at the top that looks like a mobile device (or hitting crtl + shift + m), and selecting a display option from the bar at the top.
